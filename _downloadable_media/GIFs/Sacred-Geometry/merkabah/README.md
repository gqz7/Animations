## Merkabah

##### from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism)

    Merkabah/Merkavah (Hebrew: מרכבה‎) mysticism (or Chariot mysticism) is a school of early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, centered on visions such as those found in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1, or in the heikhalot ("palaces") literature, concerning stories of ascents to the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God

### This is my first animation with the merkabah, it is best when interacted with to best picture it in 3D
#### this is only a 2D projection of a 3D object, I've provided two angles for better comprehension.
